# Movie App
The movie application is a web-based application that displays information about movies. 
Upon opening the application, users are presented with a search bar where they can type in the name of a movie they wish to look up. The application uses an API to retrieve information about the movie, such as its title, release date, genre, and a brief synopsis. 
The application also displays a poster or image related to the movie to provide users with a visual representation.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, API

I was focused on making a simple application for searching movie information

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I add more sections and sort movies by genres 


## Examples:
